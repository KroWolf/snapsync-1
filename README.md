# slapsync
rotorsync rewritten.. simpler and more transparent 
  instead of altering my current rotorsync repo, I've rewritten this script to simplify the process of keeping 
rsync incremental system/config snapshots and automating them for use on either laptops or desktops. Includes configuration files 
systemd service and timer units. may add future mount/udev rules for automating snasphots to external media. Also a backup 
restore function coming soon. This script utility is not focused on backing up personal data.
